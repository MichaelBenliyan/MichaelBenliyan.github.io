								<h3><u>Car Racing Game w/ Machine Learning AI</u></h3>
								<h4>Technologies: NEAT | Python | Pygame</h4>
									<p>This is a car racing game against a Machine Learning AI trained using the NEAT module in Python. The game supports pixel-perfect collisions and has 3 difficulty setting. Each difficulty setting has 5 levels to complete.</p>
									<p>The Machine Learning Simulator took 6 inputs: 5 distance radars measured in 45 degree intervals from left to right and the car's angle. These inputs were linked to only one output: turn right. The fitness function rewarded the cars for every tick they didn't hit a wall but replaced the value with the inverse of their laptime. This was done in order to promote surviving until the AI learned its way around the track, then, the fitness function would be optomizing for fastest laptime around the track.</p>

								<h2 class="major">My Journey</h2>

								<h3><u>UnderGrad</u></h3>
								<p>
									I began studying at University of California, Irvine as a freshman in 2015. I was admitted as a Bio-Medical Physics Major and spent 
									my first year in the hard sciences. Although I was enjoying my classes, after my first year I became interested in pursuing a career 
									in law. I started working at an attorney service office to build first-hand experience in the industry. As a result, in my second year 
									I changed my major to one more relevant to law: Criminology, Law and Society. I graduated UCI in 2020 with a Degree in CLS, a minor in 
									Psychology, and a minor in Philosophy.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/uci.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3><u>Law School Admission</u></h3>
								<p>
									After graduating I began to put together an application for Law School. At this point I already had years of experience working in all 
									3 sectors of legal proceedings: Court Filings, Process Service, and Records Retrieval. I set my focus on the LSAT (Law School Admissions 
									Test) and began studying. In October 2021 I scored a 174/180 on the LSAT which is a 99th percentile score and applied to Law Schools shorty 
									after. After a few months I received responses from schools. I was admitted with the President's Scholarship to UF Levine Law, ranked 21 in 
									the country according to USNews, which meant I could attend Law School for only $10,000/year. I had accomplished the goal I had been working towards 
									since my sophomore year of college and yet, I wanted something else. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/uf.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<h3><u>The Decision to Change Career Paths</u></h3>
								<p>
									I became very interested in Software Engineering during my last two years of university. I had two roomates who were majoring in Computer Science 
									and I started asking them to walk me through what they were doing/learning in school. At that time I also started watching YouTube videos where people 
									would show and talk about different projects that they had built. One day one of my roomates asked me, "Why don't you pursue a career in Software 
									Engineering? You're obviously very interested." He continued, "You know you could do it if you want to, there's bootcamps and other resources if you 
									don't want to get a whole new degree." At the time I didn't take him seriously and although I would have loved to switch career paths, I felt that it 
									was too late for me to do so. Fast forward a couple years to October 2021. I am three weeks away from taking the LSAT and after a few long conversations 
									with friends, I decided I was going to give programming a chance. My plan was to study programming while waiting for responses from Law Schools. I was so 
									excited about my plan I actually spent 2 of the last 3 weeks leading up to the LSAT learning the basics of programming! I was passionate and interested in 
									what I was learning in a way that I hadn't felt since my freshman year of university and I knew that I needed to pusue a career in Software Development.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/career_change.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<h3><u>Learning to Code</u></h3>
								<h4><u>The Basics</u></h4>
								<p>
									After sending out my Law School applications, I got to work on learning how to code. Studying for the LSAT over the previous year taught me what true focus, 
									hard-work, and dedication looked like and I applied those lessons I learned to coding. I asked my university roomate Gevork to be my mentor and help map out 
									a plan of what I should be learning. With his guidance I started learning the basics of programming: variables, loops, control flow, operators, and functions. 
									As I continued my learning journey I learned about classes, libraries, and datatypes. To help me progress, Gevork would give me a challenge project to build 
									every few weeks. He would try to pick something just outside of my comfort zone and would always tell me, "If you are making a project that you already know 
									how to make, you are wasting your time." Some of the projects he had me build include Snake, Conway's Game of Life, and a webcrawler. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/the_basics.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4><u>Data Structures and Algorithms</u></h4>
								<p>
									After I showed enough competence in the basics, he told me it was time for me to learn about data structures and algorithms. The approach I took was to first 
									go learn a data structure or algorithm on my own and focus on understanding how it worked. Then, I would present the data structure or algorithm to Gevork and he would ask me questions 
									about it such as "what is the time complexity for the various operations of the data structure/algorithm?", "what are the advantages/disadvantages to the different way you 
									could implement the data structure/algorithm?", and "what are some use cases for this data structure/algorithm?". This approach proved to be very effective in 
									helping me internalize all the concepts I was learning and because Gevork would ask great questions, he helped to ensure I had a deep understanding of each topic.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/data_structures.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4><u>Projects</u></h4>
								<h5><u>Automated Court Notification Checker</u></h5>
								<p>
									Once I developed an understanding of the common data structures and many of the common algorithms, it was time for me to challenge myself by building some projects. 
									In the course of my learning I realized that there was always a big difference in learning something in a vacuum versus actually implimenting it in a project enviornment. 
									I wanted the first major project I built to be directly useful to me, therefore I chose to automate my Court Notification service. I used the knowledge I had in BeatufiulSoup 
									from the webcrawler to automate the Court Notification service at my company. Unfortunately the websites for the Courts were not uniform and they even used different date formats 
									across them. What I did to overcome this was group the websites based on date format and group them by the html tags I was going to search. I made a dictionary for each set of 
									groupings and by using labels in the Excel file that linked each website with its appropriate grouping, I was able to search all the websites while also minimizing hard-coded elements. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Court_Notification.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h5><u>Shared Music Rooms</u></h5>
								<p>
									I wanted the next project I built to give me an understanding of web-development. Up until this point I had only build games or scripts, nothing that integrated with the web. 
									I chose to work in Django for the backend due to my experience in Python and chose React for the frontend because from what I understood that was the industry standard at the time. 
									I again wanted to the project to serve a practical use in my life and after some brainstorming I came to the conclusion I should build a shared music room. We listen to a lot of music 
									in my friend group and would run into the inconvenience of needing one person solely responsible for the music. I wanted to build a system that would allow all of us to connect on a website
									and allow a more democratic control of the music. I ended up building a web-app that would allow us to join a room together which allows skipping the host's song via a votting system and pause
									the host's music remotely. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/create_room.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h5><u>Car Racing Game v1</u></h5>
								<p>
									After getting some experience in a web-app, I wanted to build another game. I really enjoyed working on my Battleship and Snake games, however, I wanted to take it to the next level. Being 
									a car guy, I decided to build a racing game. Although I had experience building games before, this project introduced a set of challenges I hadn't previously faced. I first worked on developing 
									the set of systems which was going to allow the player to move around the track, bounce off the walls, and support pixel-perfect collisions. Once I had that working, I moved on the NPC car that 
									the player was supposed to race against. In order to do this I would set target points along the track that my NPC car was to move towards. This required working with a lot of trigonometry in order 
									for the car to properly calculate the angle and direction to the next target. Although I had a working NPC car that could drive my track at different speeds, I did not like how hard-coded it was. 
									I would not be able to add more tracks to my game without setting new target points for every track. Also the car would not find the most efficient path around the track but rather whatever it could 
									manage in order to reach the next target.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/racing_game_v1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h5><u>Machine Learning Simulator</u></h5>
									To fix these issues I decided to build a Machine Learning Simulation in order to train an AI to go around the track without any targets. I used the NEAT module in Python to accomplish this. It 
									took a lot of trial and error in order to optimize the fitness function, the config file, and the input/outputs of the AI. Ultimately I learned that the simpler I keep the inputs/outputs, the more
									efficiently my algorithm would learn. My final result took 6 inputs and 1 output. The inputs were 5 distance radars stagered in 45 degree incriments from the center of the car pointing to the left. 
									The output was simply when to turn right. (I programmed the AI car to always be moving foreward and to the left in order to minimize outputs.) My fitness function first rewards cars for how long they 
									can stay alive. Promoting cars to keep exploring the track and avoid hitting walls, which results in a game over for the car. Once the cars reach the finish line, their fitness value is replaced with 
									a new value proportional to the inverse of their laptime, yet significantly larger than their possible accumulated fitness up until that point. This allows the cars to be rewarded for simply staying 
									alive and exploring at first, then rewarded for the fastest laptime. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/machine_learning.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h5><u>Car Racing Game v2</u></h5>
									After having a fully functioning Machine Learning Simulator, I needed a way to save my best performing car and use that save to race against the player in the original game. I used the Pickle module 
									in Python in order to accomplish this. Due to the new versatility that the AI now had over the previous NPC car, I decided to expand further on the game. Rather than having 5 levels for the player to 
									progress through, I gave players the option of chosing an overall difficulty setting which each have 5 levels of progression within them. The game was starting to come together and I wanted to challenge 
									myself to build interactice menus within my game since I had never done that before. I made a few images using Photoshop and restructured the control flow of the game to support these new menus. With that 
									the game was complete.
