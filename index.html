								<h3><u>UnderGrad</u></h3>
								<p>
									I began learning at University of California, Irvine as a freshman in 2015. I was admitted as a Bio-Medical Physics Major and spent 
									my first year in the hard sciences. Although I was enjoying my classes, after my first year I became interested in pursuing a career 
									in law. I started working at an attorney service office to build firt-hand experience in the industry. As a result, in my second year 
									I changed my major to one more relevant to law: Criminology, Law and Society. I graduated UCI in 2020 with a Degree in CLS, a minor in 
									Psychology, and a minor in Philosophy.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/uci.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3><u>Law School Admission</u></h3>
								<p>
									After graduating I began to put together an application for Law School. At this point I already had years of experience working in all 
									3 sectors of legal proceedings: Court Filings, Process Service, and Records Retrieval. I set my focus on the LSAT (Law School Admissions 
									Test) and began studying. In October 2021 I scored a 174/180 on the LSAT which is a 99th percentile score and applied to Law Schools shorty 
									after. After a few months I received responses from schools. I was admitted with the President's Scholarship to UF Levine Law, ranked 21 in 
									the country according to USNews, which meant I could attend Law School for only $10,000/year. I had accomplished the goal I had been working towards 
									since my sophomore year of college and yet, I wanted something else.

								<h3><u>Car Racing Game w/ Machine Learning AI</u></h3>
								<h4>Technologies: NEAT | Python | Pygame</h4>
									<p>This is a car racing game against a Machine Learning AI trained using the NEAT module in Python. The game supports pixel-perfect collisions and has 3 difficulty setting. Each difficulty setting has 5 levels to complete.</p>
									<p>The Machine Learning Simulator took 6 inputs: 5 distance radars measured in 45 degree intervals from left to right and the car's angle. These inputs were linked to only one output: turn right. The fitness function rewarded the cars for every tick they didn't hit a wall but replaced the value with the inverse of their laptime. This was done in order to promote surviving until the AI learned its way around the track, then, the fitness function would be optomizing for fastest laptime around the track.</p>

								<h3><u><i>May 10, 2022</i></u></h3>
									<p>Building out Personal Website. Added descriptions for all of my projects and added buttons for each that link to the Gitpod and the Github repositories.</p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>May 9, 2022</u></i></h3>
									<p>Properly formatted my GitHub to have repositories for each of my projects with README files for each. Integrated a link to a Gitpod virtual workspace in each where people can run my projects in browser. Added a dynamically changing background to my Shared Music Rooms Project. Used the lessons I learned from making my Racing Game compatible with Gitpod to now also allow my Shared Music Rooms project to use simple browser and port 8000 to be accessible through the browser.</p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>First time integrating a Gitpod virtual workspace in order to have my projects be accessible online. Ran into the challenge that Pygame requires popping up a new window which isn't supported natively in Gitpod. Had to learn a workaround using a virtual desktop using a dockerfile and port 6080 that created a virtual desktop within which Pygame was able to pop open the new window. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->
							
								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Learned about the formatting that .md file extension provides over .txt which was what I was initially using for my README files. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Learned how to remove files from my Github repositories.</p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Learned what forking a repository means and how forks can be merged with origin. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->
							
								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Learned the benefits of actually writing my code within my local repository. My ide (VScode) tracks all new changes vs the latest push automatically. Also makes it much easier to have version control and go back versions incase I break something. I would previously work off of a local copy of the project and move it to the repository folder to push to Github. </p>

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Now that my AI is finally completing the track I need to learn how to save the winner in order to use that winner to run it against the player. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Radars have been excellent in developing the AI. Initially I had three radars: right, left, and forward. That wasn’t enough data so I added 2 more pointers at 45 degree angles between left and forward and between right and forward. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->
							
								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Created graphics for the Main Menu, Win Screen, Lose Screen, and the End Screen for the Racing Game. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Used pickle to save winners and be able to compare them. Took the most optimal save file and restructured the original game in order for it to support both the player car and the new Trained AI car.</p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Had to rework my games turning system. As a result of needing to support pixel perfect collisions the previous turning system was creating a new rectangle for the car. This new rectangle was oriented by the top left point on the screen which is typical in Pygame. However, this would result in my distance radars also measuring from the top left of the car leading to inconsistent measurements as the car would move around the track. New turning system orients the new rectangle based on the top middle location of the car, still supports pixel perfect collisions, and now has consistent radar readings. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->
								
								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Learned how I could implement distance radars for my AI in order to get more relevant data, significantly increasing training speed. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Learned about the differences between fully connected and unconnected inputs/outputs in NEAT module. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>I was previously giving my AI 3 outputs: left turn, right turn, move forward. I realized I could decrease training time and make the inputs/outputs simpler by making the AI car always be turning left and moving forward, making the AI only need to control when it turns right. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->
								
								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Still struggling to get the AI around the track. Tried multiple different fitness functions, tried checkpoints along the route to guide the car, and even tried to pass in a numpy array of the border itself. The numpy of the border seems to be having the best results however it is too intensive of a computation and I could only run very small population sizes leading to very slow learning speeds. Other solutions still can’t get passed the second turn of the track. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Created a working sim that was able to make the first turn (right turn) but it keeps getting stuck at the second turn of the track. (Left turn) I think the AI is learning that a right turn can lead it to fitness and therefore not turning left. I tried to counteract this by giving the AI fitness for left turns, however, I think the only generations that make it out of the first turn are the ones that have abandoned the idea of turning left. I need to come up with more valuable inputs to my AI.</p>

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Optimized acceleration function for all car speeds and made the bounce-off deceleration independent from the car’s typical deceleration rate fixing the previous issue. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->

								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Fixed the bouncing mechanic to have a delay in order to prevent the player from continuously being bounced off the wall. Still running into the issue at fast car speeds of the acceleration of moving forward being too slow or the deceleration off the bounce being too slow. </p>
									<!-- <i>view</i> -->
								
								<h3><u><i>Date</i></u></h3>
									<p>Bouncing mechanic in the car racing game isn’t working as intended and is leading to a bug where the player can get stuck in walls or even be pushed through walls and end up off the track. </p>
